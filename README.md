# A-Game-I-Made-in-Ren.py-For-A-School-Project
Okay somehow, this game was picked for our Symposium back in 2024. They looked at this and thought it was great I guess, but nah it's quite simple. Visual Novel esk quiz game but with Java, HTML, and Javascript (I believe). This version is Version1 btw, this is not what we presented as the final project (I lost the final version cuz I deleted it)
